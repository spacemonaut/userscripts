# Stack Exchange Chat User History Pagination

This page adds some pagination to a user's chat history page on the Stack Exchange chat network (the page you reach via: their profile -> recent).

It adds these buttons at the top and bottom:

* *prev* & *next*
* *prev 10* & *next 10* for navigating 10 pages at a time
* *first* for for page 0

Page 0 is the first page. The *first* & *prev 10* buttons will show up on the left hand side and only when they're relevant.
(Mostly to be out of your way and not mess around with button positions.)
